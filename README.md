 # :deciduous_tree: Treehouse Projects and Practice :deciduous_tree:

The following just projects and practice that I have been doing on Treehouse. This is just a compilation of completed work and practice. It's is a way to stay focus on what I am learning throughout the given Track

### Understanding List in Python

:memo: **shop_list.py:** is a project that you can track an ongoing shopping list. It uses the concepts of `break` and `continue` which was something new at this section of the track. 

:heavy_exclamation_mark: *Challenges:* Some of the challenges I encountered while coding this was the concept of spacing in python, when I was not concious of spacing I found that would often break the code. Also at first lists seemed very daunting in how it was done but after running through this lesson I was able to understand the complexity in how to really use list.
